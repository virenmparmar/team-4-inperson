"Great professor, replies all the questions in Slack. Lectures are pretty clear and get interesting when go into the topic like trees, DP and graphs. If you've done a bunch of algorithm/coding questions before, this course won't be hard for you.",5,3934,1
"The presentation of lectures by the professor is amazing. Very easy to understand all the concepts but her assignments and tests are ridiculous hard for no reason. The experience of learning and your motivation for the class are destroyed in seconds. So, be prepared to spend on her class about 15+ hours a week, if not, you won't make it.",3,3934,2
"Best professor I've had at Tandon, took her for Foundations too. The class is a ton of work but if you put in the hours, you will learn the material inside and out and build a great theoretical CS foundation. I'm guessing the bad reviews are because of the workload, but if you really want to learn the concepts this is your best bet.",5,3934,3
Professor makes tons of mistakes on her lecture notes. Her assignment questions are HARD. Algorithms is not an easy class and she makes it much more difficult than needed to be. The way she formatted the class needs to be changed.,1,3934,4
So good! One of the best professors I've ever had the pleasure of knowing! Algorithms can be an extremely difficult and time-consuming course but Greg will guide you through everything and always makes sure his exams and assignments are very easy to understand and learn from. Take his class if you want a GPA boost!,5,3583,5
Algorithms with Greg was the best math class I have ever taken in my life. I can't disagree more with the negative reviewers. He put so much care into the lessons and was very responsive to emails. He held office hours every day. more importantly the lectures were great. He really has a flair for teaching discrete math and algorithms.,5,3583,6
"This class no matter who you take is going to be hard but the professor didn't really do much to help students out. There were lots of office hours, however, he talks down to students a lot. You are only graded on the exams and there isn't much clarity on what's going to be on it. Avoid this class if you can.",1,3583,7
"PROS: Engaging in-person lecturer, unique approach to algos, homework optional, tons of practice material, does not require fiddly proofs, loves his subject, smart CONS: Course is too big, TAs are not great, online communication is poor, grading is demoralizing Take him if you like to work hard, and can get him in-person.",4,3583,8
"Really tough course, had to spend atleast 10-20 hrs per week for a foundations course,",1,4921,9
"Really Really tough course. Its a course in pure discrete maths and be sure what you are signing up for. Professor does a good job of explaining the concepts, offers lots of help. However, that does not takes away the fact that it is a very difficult class and will require lots of effort. If you do not have any prior background, be ready to slog.",3,4921,10
"Definitely intense, requires you put in a lot of work. Very clear explanations, but expects a lot. Homework is difficult and you definitely need to start ASAP and let the problems roll around for a while. Attend office hours, ask questions. Exams are also difficult, but put in the work and you'll do well.",5,4921,11
"Prof. McLeish is great at teaching and super caring. If you ask questions, she's always willing to help during live sessions, during office hours, or even during individual sessions. If you do the work and study, you'll do fine. There are a lot of practice problems available each week, but these aren't graded (still do them all!).",4,4921,12
